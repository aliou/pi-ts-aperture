# @aliou/pi-ts-aperture

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- ebb9556: Initial release. Route Pi LLM providers through Tailscale Aperture.

  - `/aperture:setup` interactive wizard (base URL + provider multi-select)
  - `/aperture:settings` settings UI for updating configuration
  - Auto-registers selected providers with Aperture base URL on load

### Patch Changes

- 7388139: Fix providers not taking effect immediately after setup/settings save. Register directly on modelRegistry and re-resolve the active model when it belongs to a reconfigured provider.
